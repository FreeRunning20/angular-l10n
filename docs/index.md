# Angular localization
> An Angular library to translate messages, dates and numbers

This library is for localization of **Angular** apps. 
It allows, in addition to translation, to localize numbers and dates of your app, adding _language code_, _country code_, _currency code_, _timezone_ and optionally _script code_, _numbering system_ and _calendar_, through [Internationalization API](spec/configuration.md#intl-api). It also implements the validation of numbers by locales.
